# Proposal for the New Governance Model for Israel: "Direct Citizen Government"

## Introduction: A Vision for New Governance
The proposal presented here introduces a revolutionary governance model for the State of Israel, combining direct and representative democracy, governmental professionalism, full transparency, and personal accountability of elected officials. The model's objective is to bridge the growing gaps in Israeli society, resolve social conflicts through local decisions, and build an efficient, stable, and responsive government that is attentive to the needs of its citizens. The technological core of this model is the "Dream Team" website, which will serve as the central platform for selection, oversight, and public participation.

## Core Principles of "Direct Citizen Government"

* **Direct Mandate and Participatory Democracy:** A direct connection between the public and government ministries through the direct election of ministers, based on pre-declared, binding work plans.

* **Professionalism and Broad Representation:** Ensuring appointments based on qualifications and broad, not sectoral, representation of interests, while guaranteeing diverse representation of regions and lifestyles across all government institutions.

* **Integrity and Moral Purity:** Strict requirements for ethical and personal transparency from every candidate and elected official, which will serve as a threshold condition for holding public office.

* **Stability and Coordination:** Creation of coordination and authority mechanisms to ensure coherent and stable governmental functioning, with clear accountability for the Prime Minister regarding the achievement of national goals.

* **Enhanced Transparency and Accountability:** Public oversight and objective external evaluation of government performance, alongside personal accountability of elected officials, and complete detachment of salary determination from the hands of elected officials.

* **Proactive and Modern Governance:** Future planning and investment in technology (such as artificial intelligence) to improve governance, streamline processes, and provide advanced services to citizens.

## Proposed Changes to the Governmental Structure

### 1. New Election System – "The Expanded Citizen Card"

* **Unification of Local and National Elections:** All election systems will take place on the same day, using an "Expanded Citizen Voting Card" (digital or physical). This will include voting for Prime Minister, selected ministers, the Knesset, head of the local authority, council members, and – for the character of the local authority.

* **Election of Local Authority Character (Mandatory for Every Voter):**
    * In every local authority, in addition to electing its representatives, residents will vote on the "character of the authority."
    * The choice will be from categories defined in the Basic Law "Character of the Authority," such as: Secular-Liberal, Traditional-Communal, Religious-Zionist, Haredi, Muslim, Christian, Mixed/Pluralistic.
    * **Meaning of the Character:** The chosen character will serve as a binding legal basis for determining municipal bylaws and rules of conduct in the public space of that authority (for example: public transport on Shabbat, opening businesses, dress codes in public buildings, allocation of resources to religious/cultural institutions).
    * **Required Majority for Change of Character:** The character will be determined by a majority of at least 60% of all voters in that authority. If this majority is not achieved, the character will be determined by a simple majority, but special protection mechanisms for minority rights will be activated. A change in character will only be possible in the next elections (every 5 years) and with a similar majority.

* **Knesset Elections and Regional/Lifestyle Representation:**
    * 70-80 mandates will be elected by regional-proportional representation, divided into approximately 12 electoral districts.
    * **District Division Based on Local Authority Character:** Geographical districts will be composed of clusters of local authorities with a similar character (as chosen by their residents). This will ensure that representatives from each district represent a population with a defined lifestyle and needs.
    * 40-50 mandates will be elected by national-proportional representation (party lists), to preserve general party representation.
    * The electoral threshold will be raised to 4.5%.
    * **Cross-sectional Representation in Knesset Committees:** Representatives from each of the approximately 12 electoral districts will be permanently and broadly assigned to all permanent committees in the Knesset. This will ensure that every district has a voice and a representative in every committee, thereby ensuring that all needs and minority voices from all parts of the country and all walks of life are heard and fully expressed.

* **Direct Election of the Prime Minister and Ministers in Key Ministries (up to 18):**
    * Up to 18 central government ministries will be defined in Basic Law as those whose minister will be directly elected by the public.
    * **Role-Focused Campaign and Obligation to Present Plans:** Candidates will conduct a campaign focused on their professional vision, work plans, and specific qualifications for the ministry they are running for. They will be required to present a detailed five-year plan and a long-term vision (for example, until 2048), as well as a detailed work plan for the first year in office, including measurable goals, concrete legislative proposals, and funding sources.
    * **Strict Threshold Requirements for Ethics and Integrity (to be displayed in a public profile on the website):**
        * **Police Approval:** Absence of relevant criminal record.
        * **Asset Declaration:** Detailed, public, and accessible declaration.
        * **Conflict of Interest Document:** Detailed, public, and approved by an independent legal counsel.

### 2. Small, Professional, and Coordinated Government

* **Limiting the Number of Ministries and Ministers:** Basic Law will define the number of government ministries (up to 18) and the maximum number of ministers (up to 20).
* **Binding "Shared National Vision":** The Prime Minister and elected ministers will be required, within 30 days of their formation, to formulate and approve a "Shared National Vision" and a multi-year work plan that will be a binding document for the entire government.
* **"Strategic Cabinet of Ministers":** A small cabinet (up to 7 ministers) with overarching authority to make broad policy decisions and resolve inter-ministerial conflicts by a qualified majority.
* **Dispute Resolution Mechanism:** Fundamental disputes will be brought for resolution by an expanded panel of the Supreme Court (on constitutional matters).
* **Professional Appointments:** Directors-general, heads of departments, legal advisors, and senior officials in government ministries will be appointed based solely on professional tenders, and their tenure will not depend on the identity of the elected minister.
* **Term Limits:** Prime Minister – two terms only. Elected ministers – two consecutive terms in the same ministry (total up to 10 years in any ministerial role).

### 3. Transparency, Accountability, and Efficiency of Government and Knesset Work

* **Mandatory Detailed and Public Work Plans:** Every minister will be required to present five-year and annual plans, including measurable goals, legislative steps, and funding sources.
* **Oversight by "Supreme Performance Directorate":** A professional, independent, and public body will continuously oversee ministers' adherence to goals and publish transparent periodic reports.
* **Compensation and Evaluation Mechanism:**
    * **Fixed Salary:** The salary of ministers and Knesset members will be defined by law as a fixed multiple of the national minimum wage and will be disconnected from self-determination.
    * **Performance-Based Bonuses:** A portion of ministers' salaries will be paid only according to proven adherence to defined goals, and will be evaluated by the Supreme Directorate.
    * **"Performance Improvement Plan":** A minister who fails to meet goals will enter a performance improvement plan under supervision. Failure to meet goals even after this could lead to a public recommendation for dismissal.

* **Public Consensus Discussions (Post-election):** Public and televised discussions between elected ministers and opposition candidates to forge agreements on core issues.
* **"Special Basic Laws" with Qualified Majority:** Amending essential Basic Laws will require a qualified majority of at least 75 Knesset members in three readings.

## Profile of the "Dream Team" Website – The Digital Platform for New Governance

The "Dream Team" website is the digital core of the "Direct Citizen Government" model. It centralizes information, discussion, and civic influence, aiming to connect citizens directly with their elected officials, ensure maximum transparency, professionalism, and true representation, and foster a new political culture based on accountability, partnership, and trust.

### 1. Security and Identity Verification – The Basis for Public Trust

* **Secure, One-Time Login:** Mandatory registration for every citizen over 18.
* **Strong Identity Verification (MFA):** Strict verification using ID number (against the population registry), mobile phone number (one-time code), residential address, and date of birth. Future option for biometric verification.
* **Limitation to One-Time Participation:** The system will ensure that a citizen can participate in building the "Dream Team" (and subsequently in actual voting) only once for each role/election.
* **Advanced Encryption and Regular Security Audits:** Protection of user data and privacy.

### 2. Candidate Submission Module – Maximum Transparency for the Public

* The website will allow any citizen over 18 to submit their candidacy for Prime Minister, a minister in a key ministry (up to 18), a district representative to the Knesset, head of a local authority, and a council member.

* **Required Information from Each Candidate (to be displayed in a public profile):**
    * **Police Approval:** Absence of relevant criminal record.

* Candidates can add one question to a questionnaire that other candidates will need to answer.

* Candidate submission will be time-limited between dates defined by the site administrator. After the submission period, voters, including candidates, will be able to choose their team, also limited to a period defined by the site administrator.

### 3. "Dream Team Building" Module – Personal and Public Customization

* **"Expanded Citizen Card" (Simulation and Voting):** An interactive tool for selecting candidates for every role.
    * **For Each Ministerial Role:** Selection of a candidate for Prime Minister and for each of the 18 selected government ministries.
    * **For Knesset and Local Authority Representatives:** Selection of candidates only in the district of residence and the municipality of residence.

* **Comprehensive Matching Questionnaire (100 questions):**
    * **Integral Part of the Experience:** The citizen will complete a comprehensive questionnaire for all ministerial areas (detailed below).
    * **Smart Matching Mechanism:** The system will build an "ideal profile" for the voter and display a compatibility score in percentages between their profile and the candidates' positions (who also answered the questionnaire). Short verbal explanations from candidates and references to their work plans will also be shown, as well as a tool for comparing candidates.

### 4. User Interface and Data Display – Accessibility and Transparency
