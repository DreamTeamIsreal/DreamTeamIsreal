    "paragraph1": "The new model is based on the principle of direct election of government ministers by citizens. Unlike the current system, where citizens elect parties and parties appoint ministers, in the new model citizens directly elect the individuals who will form the government.",
    "paragraph2": "The election process is conducted through a secure digital platform, where every citizen has the right to choose their preferred candidate for each government role. The choice is based on a comprehensive 100-question suitability questionnaire that allows the system to present each citizen with the candidates most suitable to their views and values.",
    "paragraph3": "Candidates are required to meet strict transparency requirements, including submitting a police clearance, a detailed asset declaration, a conflict of interest document, and a detailed five-year work plan. All information is publicly available on the platform's website.",
